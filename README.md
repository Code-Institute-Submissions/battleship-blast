STRAGETY:
---------

* * *

Create a cool and strategic looking, yet easy to navigate interactive game of Battleships that allows the player to play against the computer who will generate its hidden ship coordinates at random. 
The user will have a set number of missils, and the results will be displayed throughout the game. Once all missils have been launched (or the user manages to sink all ships) the game will display the Game Result, and allow for the option to _Play Again_.


The site aesthetic is very simple, retro 80's PC: as it is all on the terminal I wanted to keep it with the classic old school green font,
Create a code that is clear and allows to update with ease. The game can be eaisly navigated by the user!

* * * 

STRUCTURE:
----------

* * *

### Initial Game Load

* * *

#### _Header - Game Title_

*   The Game title is displayed as soon as the game is launched. Minimalist uppercase green font: B A T T L E F I E L D S

<img src="assets/images/homescreen.png" width="500px">


* * * 

### Menu Selection 

* * *

The initial M E N U section is simple, to the point and consists of 3 navigation options:

* 1 : Game Instructions
* 2 : Launch Game

<img src="assets/images/menu.png" width="500px">

* * * 
  
### Game Instructions 

* * *

When typing 1 into the terminal, the user is directed to this page consisting of game instructions.

* Ths contains a header labelled I N S T R U C T I O N S. All section headers are displayed in a similar style (uppercase, gaps in between letters)
* The instructions which are:
    * Clear and consise
    * Arranged in bullet points
    * Separated into relevant sections.
*The user must type M to return to the M E N U.

<img src="assets/images/instructions.png" width="500px">

* * * 


### Exit Game

* * *

From MENU, when typing 3 into the terminal, the user is directed to the EXIT GAME section.

* This contains a header labelled QUIT GAME.
* A few lines which aim to convince the user to stay on. The language challenges the user.
* 2 options (user must type selection):
    * Y to quit now : which leads to GAME OVER

<img src="assets/images/exit1.png" width="500px">
  
* * * 

### Game Over 

* * *

From Q U I T  G A M E, when typing Y into the terminal, the user is directed to the G A M E  O V E R section

This section simply displays the words G A M E  O V E R.

<img src="assets/images/gameover.png" width="500px">


### Grid Choice 

* * *

From MENU, when typing 2 into the terminal, player is navigated to Grid choice section

* 5 x 5 --> 5
* 8 x 8 --> 8
* 12 x 12 --> 12
* Enter user selection.


<img src="assets/images/grid-selection.png" width="500px">


* * *

### Launch Game Rounds

* * *

From grid selection, the user is finally directed to the GAME section.
This displays:
* Header labelled T H E  B A T T L E F I E L D
* The board grid:
    * 5 x 5, 8 x 8 or 12 x 12
    * Rows: A B C D E ...
    * Columns: A B C D E ...
    * Each cooridnate is represented by a .
* Enter ROW input
* Enter COLUMN input

<img src="assets/images/round-1.png" width="500px">

Once the user inputs both coordinates, the following options:
* Result: 
    * You sunk a ship!
    * You missed!
    * You've already hit this target, Try again!!
* Selection: Launch next misile?    
    * Y - yes --> next round
    * N - No (And a reminder, that if quiting, all advances will be lost)

<img src="assets/images/round-2.png" width="500px">


If selecting N, the user is directed to EXIT GAME section.

* * *

If selecting L:

The layout remains the same.
The grid has been updated.
The coordinate previously selected will have:
* "X" - hit ship
* "-" - miss

## THE CODE:

* * *

Prior to commencing to write my code out, I planned out the functions required.

<img src="./assets/images/wireframes-functions.png" width="1000px">


* * * 

## SURFACE:

* * *
* When initially planning this game, knowing it would be ran in a terminal only i knew it would be minimalistic.
* Before starting, I created the wireframes displayed above. I knew I wanted the game to be minimal, retro 80's PC style.

<img src="./assets/images/wireframes-visual.png" width="800px">
<img src="./assets/images/wireframe-grid-size.png" width="260px">

* * *

### Colors

* * *

 When discovering more python packages, I decided to incorporate termcolor to add a pop of color to my terminal.
 I decided to go with a retro, 80's style console and incorporated a GREEN font.

<img src="./assets/images/retro-terminal.png" width="800px">


* * * 

### Typography

* * *

Using the standard console typography: but played around with a few things
* Use of spacing in headers : H E A D E R
* Use of "************" for page break and separation


<img src="assets/images/spaces-letters-font.png" width="500px">

### Images and Icons

* * *

No use of image or icons.
Everything was built using letters, numbers, typographical symbols and punctuation to create the grid.

    Both cases, request is looped until validation anticipates the following possible errors:
        * Must be alphabetical
        * Must be in predetermined list with values determined by for loop with range(grid_size) which creates an alphabetical list to cover this range.

<img src="assets/images/error-5.png" width="500px"> 

* AFTER SUBMITTING COORDINATES - results added!
    * Message confirming hit, miss, or repeated coordinate.
    * Options, launch next misile?

### Tests

* * *

#### [Pep8](http://pep8online.com/)

Tested and no errors found.

<img src="assets/images/no-errors.png" width="800px">


Warnings:
* The empty headers are for spaced that will be filled out using Javascript code
* The section area warning suggesting a h2-h6 element: I don't think the form needs a header as it is pretty self explanatory.


<img src="assets/images/html-validator.png" width="800px">

* * *

#### Manual testing 

* * * 

Testing this game manualy was a long and very detailed process. No errors were found.

* * *


*   INTRODUCTION: The initial page loads correctly, with no problems displaying its content.
    * Player name input form (required, and validated before submitting):
        * Input must be validated. To do so, I created a function called input_player_name. This required the user to input an alphabetical string. Input will not be submitted if it is not this type of data. As seen below, it will not validate a digit, empty space or punctuation.

        <img src="assets/images/validate-name.png" width="500px"> 
        
        * This name is succesfuly stored as a variable and used a number of times throughout the game. (As seen displayed below)

        <img src="assets/images/validate-name-2.png" width="500px"> 


*   MENU: which loads once the user has input player name and it has been validated. 
    * Content is displayed clearly, and loads properly when inputing the correct Player_name data.
    * The user must input one of the 3 options. Once again, this requires validating. To do so, I created a separate function called validate_key_numerical. In this function, we anticipate the following errors
        * Input is NOT a digit
        * Input is not one of the pre-requisited valid keys listed under keys_123.
    * Play input request: loops user input request until validated. I created a validating function to anticipate any errors the user may input:
    * When testing, I can confirm that it works and the code will not accept anything other than digits 1, 2 and 3.

    <img src="assets/images/validate-menu-1.png" width="500px"> 
    <img src="assets/images/validate-menu-2.png" width="500px"> 
    <img src="assets/images/validate-menu-3.png" width="500px"> 
    <img src="assets/images/validate-menu-4.png" width="500px"> 

*   INSTRUCTIONS - can confirm that when inputing 1, user is directed to the correct section: Instructions.

    <img src="assets/images/instructions-validate-1.png" width="500px"> 

    * The content is displayed clearly in the terminal. You can see all information without having to scroll up or down.
    * Player input request must be valid: To achieve this, I created one more function called validate_key_alpha that loops the request until it is valid. This function anticipated the following errors:
        * That the (data.isalpha()) is False
        * That the input is not one of the predetermined keys listed, in this case M only.
 <img src="assets/images/menu-val.png" width="500px"> 
 <img src="assets/images/menu-val-2.png" width="500px">  
 <img src="assets/images/menu-val-3.png" width="500px"> 
<img src="assets/images/menu-val-4.png" width="500px"> 

* QUIT GAME - no issues, redirects to this section as expected when entering 3 from MENU.
    * Content is displayed clearly, and leaves for no ambiguity. 
    * Question player. Quit game? - User input must be validated before proceeding. For this section, I used the same function validate_key_alpha. In this case, we anticipate the same errors:
        * That the (data.isalpha()) is False
        * That the input is not one of the predetermined keys listed, in this case yes-no-keys list containing Y and N  only. This is looped until validation. It has been tested and I can confirm it will accept nothing other than this.

* GAME OVER - when entering Y from QUIT GAME
    * Message displaying G A M E  O V E R - no issues. Works as intended

 <img src="assets/images/gameover.png" width="500px"> 


* GRID SELECTION - when entering 2 from MENU the user is directed to the grid selection as intended. 
    * The information is displayed clearly. The user can choose between 3 grid sizes. Input must be validated.
    * Options to select from:
        * 5 x 5 (easy)
        * 8 x 8 (medium)
        * 12 x 12 (hard)
    * Input request (validated before submitting). This looped request until validation anticipates the following possible errors:
        * Must be in a predetermined list with vaues: 5, 8, 12
        * Must be a digit
    With manual testing, I an confirm this works as intended, and no errors occured.

###### BUGS & FIXES: 

* Loop for grid size selection. When testing this part, I noticed that when a ValueError occured with user input, the loop would only re-loop the input section. It did not include the options that could be selected. This would mean that if still commiting errors, the user would have to scroll up to gain clarification on grid size options. This was solved by changed the while True loop. I included the text into this loop. See below:

<img src="assets/images/loop-bug.png" width="500px"> 
<img src="assets/images/loop-bug-fix.png" width="500px"> 


end of launch next misile

spacing



* The gameOver function was getting quite heavy and becoming problematic particularly in displaying block and none. A tutor at code institute recommended I  use the an onload instead. This made things run much smoothly.

<img src="assets/images/launchgame-bug.png" width="600px">

* While validating my JS for bugs, I encountered a BIG problem regarding my end result. I thought I had tested it enough, but noticed that once in a while the final result displayed would be incorrect! See below:

<img src="assets/images/result-error-bug.png" width="600px">

What was happening was that the result for Round 4 was being read to come up with the final answer. Upon getting assistance from the Code Institute mentors, we discovered that there the easiest option would be to switch the order of the functions run within the playRound(e) function. We would instead place updateRound() at the ends of the function. This fixed the issue.

<img src="assets/images/result-error-bug-2.png" width="300px"><img src="assets/images/result-error-bug-3.png" width="300px">

* I noticed that during the Game rounds, the user was having to scroll down to see their result. For this reason, I decided to remove the header (Rock paper Scissors title) from the display (between rounds 1 and 5). I initially tried to change the font and button sizes, but I thought it all looked a bit too crowded. Due to deadlines, removing the header seemed to be the best way to solve this problem (for now.. I will be working on this in the future)!

### Content & Code
* A couple of the code institute tutors helped me with some issues I was having. 
    * I encountered a bug: When finishing a game and wanting to launch game again, my X's and -'s remained displayed on the board. Sean from Code Institute helped me solve this, and suggested I use the following code:

    * [Python for beginers](https://bigmonty12.github.io/battleship)        * [Stack Exchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/122970/python-simple-battleship-game)
* My peers at Code Institute Slack were also incredibly helpful!
* My mentor Chris helped me better understand how to best validate my code.
