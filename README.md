STRAGETY:
---------

* * *

Create a cool and strategic looking, yet easy to navigate interactive game of Battleships that allows the player to play against the computer who will generate its hidden ship coordinates at random. 
The user will have a set number of missils, and the results will be displayed throughout the game. Once all missils have been launched (or the user manages to sink all ships) the game will display the Game Result, and allow for the option to _Play Again_.


The site aesthetic is very simple, retro 80's PC: as it is all on the terminal I wanted to keep it with the classic old school green font,
Create a code that is clear and allows to update with ease. The game can be eaisly navigated by the user!

* * * 

STRUCTURE:

### WIREFRAMES:


* * * 

## THE CODE:

* * *

Prior to commencing to write my code out, I planned out the functions required.

<img src="./assets/images/wireframes-functions.png" width="1000px">


* * * 

## SURFACE:

* * *
* When initially planning this game, knowing it would be ran in a terminal only i knew it would be minimalistic.
* Before starting, I created the wireframes displayed above. I knew I wanted the game to be minimal, retro 80's PC style.

<img src="./assets/images/wireframes-visual.png" width="800px">
<img src="./assets/images/wireframe-grid-size.png" width="260px">

* * *

### Colors

* * *

 When discovering more python packages, I decided to incorporate termcolor to add a pop of color to my terminal.
 I decided to go with a retro, 80's style console and incorporated a GREEN font.

<img src="./assets/images/retro-terminal.png" width="800px">


* * * 

### Typography

* * *

Using the standard console typography: but played around with a few things
* Use of spacing in headers : H E A D E R
* Use of "************" for page break and separation


<img src="assets/images/spaces-letters-font.png" width="500px">

### Images and Icons

* * *

No use of image or icons.
Everything was built using letters, numbers, typographical symbols and punctuation to create the grid.

## TESTING, BUGS & FIXES:

For testing I used the following sources:

* * * 

### Tests

* * *

#### [Pep8](http://pep8online.com/)

Tested and no errors found.
Warnings:
* The empty headers are for spaced that will be filled out using Javascript code
* The section area warning suggesting a h2-h6 element: I don't think the form needs a header as it is pretty self explanatory.


<img src="assets/images/html-validator.png" width="800px">

* * *

#### Manual testing 

* * * 


* Initial page loads properly.
* Player name input is loaded properly and the valid input is required to move forward. 
* handlePlayerName() function works correctly, and takes the player name placing it under the players Rock,Paper,Scissors image on display during the rounds.
* All images load properly and are fully visible to the user.
* Nav bar is always visible and footer is fixed always displayed at the bottom of the screen and fully visible.
* The site has responsive design, allowing the website and its features to be fully displayed (visible) on all display sized: phone, tablets, laptops, larger screens.


* * * 


###### BUGS & FIXES: 
* The gameOver function was getting quite heavy and becoming problematic particularly in displaying block and none. A tutor at code institute recommended I  use the an onload instead. This made things run much smoothly.

<img src="assets/images/launchgame-bug.png" width="600px">

* While validating my JS for bugs, I encountered a BIG problem regarding my end result. I thought I had tested it enough, but noticed that once in a while the final result displayed would be incorrect! See below:

<img src="assets/images/result-error-bug.png" width="600px">

What was happening was that the result for Round 4 was being read to come up with the final answer. Upon getting assistance from the Code Institute mentors, we discovered that there the easiest option would be to switch the order of the functions run within the playRound(e) function. We would instead place updateRound() at the ends of the function. This fixed the issue.

<img src="assets/images/result-error-bug-2.png" width="300px"><img src="assets/images/result-error-bug-3.png" width="300px">

* I noticed that during the Game rounds, the user was having to scroll down to see their result. For this reason, I decided to remove the header (Rock paper Scissors title) from the display (between rounds 1 and 5). I initially tried to change the font and button sizes, but I thought it all looked a bit too crowded. Due to deadlines, removing the header seemed to be the best way to solve this problem (for now.. I will be working on this in the future)!

* * * 

#### Testing User Stories 

* * * 

1. The site is designed in a way that makes the game fun and easy to play.

YES! The styling of the site is simplistic and fun. The buttons and big and bright, and are styled when being hovered over. The page displays images of rock, paper and scissors when called upon. The images are big and bold. The rounds are clearly labelled and the results clearly displayed. It is easy for the user to Refresh the game and play again and again!

<img src="assets/images/refresh-1.png" width="300px"> <img src="assets/images/refresh-2.png" width="300px">


2. The game feels personal as the user can input their name and see it displayed throughout.

YES! The player is able to input their name into an initial form. This is required to play the game. That name is then displayed at the bottom of the user's selection. the use of this tool makes the game personal!

<img src="assets/images/name-form.png" width="300px"> <img src="assets/images/name-display.png" width="300px">


3. The game rounds and scores are displayed throughout. 

YES! Both are displayed clearly throughout the rounds.

<img src="assets/images/results-display.png" width="400px">

4. The user will want to come back for more!

This game is fun, easy to play and can be easily replayed after 5 rounds. Its styling is simplistic and fun which will leave the player wanting to come back!

* A couple of the code institute tutors helped me with some issues I was having. 
    * I encountered a bug: When finishing a game and wanting to launch game again, my X's and -'s remained displayed on the board. Sean from Code Institute helped me solve this, and suggested I use the following code:

* Coming up with how to create my grid was a challenge! After brainstorming, I researched a few different ways people had achieved this. Some of the tutorials I looked at:
    * [Code Academy](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/excellent-battleship-game-written-in-python/430605)
    * [Python for beginers](https://bigmonty12.github.io/battleship)        * [Stack Exchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/122970/python-simple-battleship-game)
* My peers at Code Institute Slack were also incredibly helpful!
* My mentor Chris helped me better understand how to best validate my code.
